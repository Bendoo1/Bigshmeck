# Welcome to the Big Shmeck Website project! #

This project has been built for users to learn more about my music artist persona Big Shmeck.

Since this is my first project there may be a number of unforeseen bugs but hopefully most of these should have been ironed out.

## UX #

This project has a desktop first approach. The website provides a clear and approachable format for all users, regardless of device or resolution. You can listen to music or find out what locations and dates I am playing on my next tour of the UK. The user will also be able to navigate around the site using the drop down menu at the top right of the page, and may also access my socials in the same way.
