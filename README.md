# Welcome to the Big Shmeck Website project! #

During the course of this readme file I will be explaining the methods I have used to complete this project in a number of sections below.

The sections will be structured as follows:

###
1. Initial Concept
2. Ideas and First Attempts
3. Corrections and Mistakes
4. Final Website Design
